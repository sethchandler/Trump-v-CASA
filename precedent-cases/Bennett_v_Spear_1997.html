    <h1>Bennett v. Spear</h1>
    <p class="citation">520 U.S. 154 (1997)<br>
    Decided March 19, 1997<br>
    Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court</p>

    <h2>Case Background</h2>
    <p>This case involved a challenge to a biological opinion issued by the Fish and Wildlife Service regarding the Klamath Irrigation Project's impact on endangered fish species. Two Oregon irrigation districts challenged water level restrictions imposed to protect endangered sucker fish in Clear Lake and Gerber reservoirs.</p>

    <div class="key-holding">
        <h2>Key Legal Questions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Do petitioners have standing under the Endangered Species Act's citizen suit provision?</li>
            <li>Can petitioners seek judicial review of the biological opinion?</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <h2>Supreme Court Holding</h2>
    <p>The Supreme Court:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Found petitioners have standing</li>
        <li>Reversed the Court of Appeals' dismissal</li>
        <li>Remanded the case for further proceedings</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Court's Reasoning</h2>
    <p>The Court emphasized that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The ESA's "any person" language broadly allows judicial review</li>
        <li>Petitioners' economic interests are "arguably within the zone of interests" protected by the statute</li>
        <li>The biological opinion has "direct and appreciable legal consequences"</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="key-holding">
        <h2>Legal Significance</h2>
        <p>This decision significantly expanded interpretations of standing and judicial review in environmental law, particularly for parties with economic interests in environmental regulations. It established that parties economically affected by environmental agency actions can challenge those actions in federal court, even when their interests may conflict with the environmental protection goals of the statute.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Impact on Environmental Law</h2>
    <p>Bennett v. Spear broadened access to federal courts for judicial review of environmental agency decisions, allowing regulated parties and those economically impacted by environmental regulations to challenge agency actions more readily.</p>
